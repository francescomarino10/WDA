"I live with bipolar disorder in Ghana, where the #COVID19 pandemic has been an unprecedented stressor to the mental health of many individuals. I have many friends who had relapses in their mental health because of the increased levels of fear and panic. It was almost as if fear was contagious.
In Ghana, a great many people – including health care workers, people with COVID-19, children, women, youth and older adults – are experiencing psychological distress and mental health symptoms as a result of the pandemic.
Most people are afraid to seek help because they think that if they visit the hospital, they might end up getting infected with COVID-19 because of the virus’ subtle mode of transmission and contraction. I myself did not go to the clinic for therapy for an entire year partly because of this fear. I was also unemployed at the time and did not have the funds for treatment. But my pensioner parents managed to make sure my medications were always refilled.
I have been privileged to have a good system of support. But it is not the same for others. Some people could not afford treatment. It was and still is a very difficult time for a lot of people. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health cannot be underestimated. It cannot be made light of." - Esenam Abra Drah, #Ghana

We currently have a good supply of #COVID19 vaccines. All people, everywhere at highest risk of severe disease - including health workers and older people - should be vaccinated with a full course of doses.

When people don't get vaccinated, viruses and bacteria are more likely to spread. Vaccinations help protect you & people around you. #LongLifeForAll

released an updated Strategic Preparedness, Readiness and Response Plan for #COVID19 - hopefully the last one. It lays out 3 possible scenarios for how the pandemic could evolve this year and how to respond. We have all the tools we need to bring this pandemic under control.

Hospitals from Spain to the Czech Republic — already stretched by the second wave of the coronavirus — fear a new influx after the holidays.
Throughout Europe, hospitals remain in a tenuous, and serious, condition. An assortment of national lockdowns, curfews and social-distancing restrictions across the continent have caused a dip in admissions for Covid-19 and intensive care occupancy. But public health officials are worried that those gains could be reversed at any moment, and that the upcoming holidays could be mass contagion events that will inundate hospitals and erase whatever small margin of breathing room they have.
From Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, hospitals are nearly bursting with coronavirus patients. Many of them are wearing transparent oxygen helmets or breathing with respirators. Many are recovering and going home. And many are still dying.

The one constant through it all has been the strain on frontline workers in hospitals who have borne greater risks than most, helped heal the sick, and pulled innumerable infected patients back from the brink of death. Tap the link in our bio to read the full story.
In the last week alone, almost 75,000 deaths from COVID19 were reported to WHO.
