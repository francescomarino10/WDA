"I live with bipolar disorder in Ghana, where the COVID19 pandemic has been an unprecedented stressor to the mental health . I have many friends who had relapses in their mental health because of the increased levels of fear and panic. It was almost as if fear was contagious.
In Ghana health care workers, people with COVID-19  are experiencing psychological distress and mental health symptoms as a result of the pandemic.
Most people are afraid to seek help because they think that if they visit the hospital, they might end up getting infected with COVID-19 because of the virus’ subtle mode of transmission and contraction. I myself did not go to the clinic for therapy for an entire year partly because of this fear. I was also unemployed at the time and did not have the funds for treatment. But my pensioner parents managed to make sure my medications were always refilled.
I have been privileged to have a good system of support. But it is not the same for others. Some people could not afford treatment. It was and still is a very difficult time. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health cannot be underestimated.
