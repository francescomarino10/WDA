"I live with bipolar disorder in Ghana, where the #COVID19 pandemic has been an unprecedented stressor to the mental health of many individuals. I have many friends who had relapses in their mental health because of the increased levels of fear and panic. It was almost as if fear was contagious.
In Ghana, a great many people – including health care workers, people with COVID-19, children, women, youth and older adults – are experiencing psychological distress and mental health symptoms as a result of the pandemic.
Most people are afraid to seek help because they think that if they visit the hospital, they might end up getting infected with COVID-19 because of the virus’ subtle mode of transmission and contraction. I myself did not go to the clinic for therapy for an entire year partly because of this fear. I was also unemployed at the time and did not have the funds for treatment. But my pensioner parents managed to make sure my medications were always refilled.
I have been privileged to have a good system of support. But it is not the same for others. Some people could not afford treatment. It was and still is a very difficult time for a lot of people. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health cannot be underestimated. It cannot be made light of." - Esenam Abra Drah, #Ghana

When people don't get vaccinated, viruses and bacteria are more likely to spread. Vaccinations help protect you & people around you. #LongLifeForAll

released an updated Strategic Preparedness, Readiness and Response Plan for #COVID19 - hopefully the last one. It lays out 3 possible scenarios for how the pandemic could evolve this year and how to respond. We have all the tools we need to bring this pandemic under control.

Postnatal contacts are recommended for healthy women & newborns between 48 and 72 hours, between seven and 14 days, and during week six after birth.
If health risks are identified, more contacts will likely be required.
Worldwide, more than 3 in 10 women & babies do not currently receive postnatal care in the first days after birth - the period when most maternal and infant deaths occur.
The birth of a baby is a life-changing moment, one that is bound by love, hope and excitement, but it can also cause unprecedented stress & anxiety.
Parents need strong health care & support systems, especially women, whose needs are too often neglected when the baby comes.

In the last week alone, almost 75,000 deaths from #COVID19 were reported to WHO.
