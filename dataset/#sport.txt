Visually impaired photographer Roesie Percy will be covering the Women‚Äôs Boat race on Sunday for The Times.
The young photographer (@a_blind_photographer) describes her work as ‚Äúvery ironic‚Äù, as she cannot see the details in her own photography. Roesie, however, looks for shapes and focuses on bold colours in her work.
Roesie writes (of image one): ‚ÄúAs a photographer, I believe that if you want to get that perfect shot, you need to do things that most people wouldn‚Äôt even think of doing. So I put my wellies on so I could get into the water to photograph those unique moments instead of seeing the obvious pictures.‚Äù
