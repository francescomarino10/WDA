Catherine Russell, @atayesheunfpa call for an immediate cessation of all attacks on health care in #Ukraine.
The horrific attacks on healthcare in 🇺🇦 are killing & causing serious injuries to patients & #healthworkers, destroying vital health infrastructure & forcing thousands to forgo accessing health services despite catastrophic needs.
To attack the most vulnerable – babies, children, pregnant women, & those already suffering from illness & disease, & health workers risking their own lives to save lives – is an act of unconscionable cruelty.
Since the start of the war, 31 attacks on health care have been documented via the WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care. In 24 incidents health care facilities were damaged or destroyed, while in 5 cases ambulances were damaged or destroyed. These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths & 34 injuries, & affected access to and availability of essential health services.
The health system in 🇺🇦 is clearly under significant strain, & its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening.
Humanitarian partners health workers must be able to safely maintain & strengthen essential health service delivery, incl. immunization against #COVID19 & polio, & the supply of life-saving medicines for civilians across 🇺🇦 as well as to refugees.
It is critical that humanitarian actors have safe & unimpeded access to reach ALL civilians in need wherever they may be.
@unicef, @unfpa & WHO are working with partners to scale up life-saving services & support to meet urgent health needs.
Health care & services should be protected from all acts of violence & obstruction. For the sake of health workers, & for all people in Ukraine who need access to the lifesaving services they provide, attacks on all health care & other civilian infrastructure must stop.
Finally, we call for an immediate ceasefire, which includes unhindered access so that people in need can access humanitarian assistance. A peaceful resolution to end the war in Ukraine is possible.

Accidents are common in Ukraine’s aging coal mines. Methane gas, a byproduct of coal mining, is highly explosive. In 2007, a methane blast killed more than 100 miners. Now, Russia’s heavy, indiscriminate bombing has added yet another threat to Ukraine’s coal mines, where personal fears and global anxieties meet.
Ukraine relies on coal for its industrial iron and steel sectors. Coal-fueled thermal power plants generate about one-third of the country’s electricity. For its supply of coal, Ukraine has relied on imports, mostly from Russia, but that supply has been cut by the war, so continuing to mine the domestic supply has become essential for survival.
The photographer @finbarroreilly traveled more than 2,000 feet underground with miners at the DTEK energy company mine in the Dobrapil district, where tunnel temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. During a recent shift, a bare-chested worker had peeled off his jacket (in contravention of safety measures) while a giant saw carved chunks of coal onto a conveyor belt. A dozen miners crouched in air so thick with coal dust that their headlamps glowed like Jedi lightsabers.
“This is hard work. Nobody will say it, but everyone waits for the end of their shift to come out and call their family to see if they’re OK,” said Vitaly, the mine manager. “We smile and laugh, but this is a difficult time for us.”

Video Shows Missile Striking Ukrainian Mall
Surveillance footage shared by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine showed the moment a Russian missile struck a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk on Monday. By Tuesday, the death toll rose to at least 18 people, with more injured and many unaccounted for.
Some 25 people had been hospitalized after the strike and 21 remained missing, Dmytro Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region, said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Rescuers were still digging through the rubble, he added, but it would be impossible for anyone else to be found alive.
“The feeling I had was as though I was flying somewhere, with my head first,” a survivor said, adding: "Everything was just exploding."

Young female activists from Eastern Europe are cornering Europe’s leaders and pressing them for a total energy embargo on Russia — to end the fighting in Ukraine and to save the planet.
Young activists like Dominika Lasota and her activist comrade, Wiktoria Jedroszkowiak, both 20, have emerged as leaders in a dynamic new wing of the antiwar movement. They say the only solution to the war in Ukraine is to accelerate the transition to renewables, like wind and solar, and that until then, more Ukrainians will needlessly die.
They circulate around the continent, riding trains, staying in cheap hotels, powering themselves on cornflakes and almond milk, trying to corner Europe’s top politicians and business people. While perhaps not as famous as Greta Thunberg, they are cut from the same hardy cloth and work closely with her Fridays for Future movement.
They have organized protests across Europe and have confronted not only President Emmanuel Macron of France but also Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister; Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament; top business people, including Total shareholders; and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, who seemed impressed.

Lviv, a city in Ukraine’s relatively safe west, is largely untouched by the war physically, but death reaches here anyway. Residents bury the bodies of soldiers killed fighting in battlefields farther east. Displaced families that fled Russian forces must inter their loved ones here, far from home.
The task of interring the dead has fallen to gravediggers, embalmers, funeral directors and coroners. These workers carry deep psychic wounds of war — and there are few who can relate to them.
“Nowadays, I feel numb,” said Antoniy, a morgue worker in Lviv. “Even when someone is telling me a joke that I know is funny, I can’t laugh. My emotions are too numbed.”
A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president recently estimated that about 100 to 200 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day, an increase from just a few weeks earlier, when President Volodymyr Zelensky said 60 to 100 were killed daily.
“We used to do one or two funerals a month. Now, we’re short-handed,” said Mikhailo, a gravedigger who buries many of the dead that Antoniy prepares for burial. “Every day there is a funeral — sometimes several at once. And they are all so young.”

A mass grave on the edge of Lysychansk, in eastern Ukraine, remains uncovered. The dead are civilians who were killed by shelling in recent months in the embattled twin cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk and the nearby town of Rubizhne. They are heaped together because there are no relatives to claim and bury their bodies.
Standing above the grave, Pvt. Sergiy Veklenko, 41, explained why the bodies were still exposed: “All of our machinery that we had in the city’s inventory — excavators and all — was given to the army for digging trenches.”
As the war grinds into its fourth month and Ukrainian and Russian casualties mount well into the thousands of dead, it is clear that the trenches also have become graves for many soldiers.
Private Veklenko, a former police officer who joined the Ukrainian army when the war began, estimates that 300 people are buried in the mass grave. “We’ve been burying people here who died since April,” he said.
As Russia solidifies control in Sievierodonetsk and shifts its focus to neighboring Lysychansk, civilian casualties there are sure to mount, unless Ukrainian forces retreat. Lysychansk, an industrial city with a prewar population of 100,000, is largely cut off from the outside world, with no cellphone service or electricity. Local officials estimate that 40,000 people remain in the city.

The leaders of France, Germany and Italy met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Thursday in their first such show of support for him since Russia’s invasion began in February. The visit comes as questions mount over European backing for Ukraine and as Zelensky calls for heavier weapons to offset Moscow’s artillery advantage.
President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy follow a host of European leaders who have traveled overland to the capital, Kyiv, with air travel off limits because of security concerns.
The European leaders also traveled to Irpin, a Kyiv suburb where investigators are looking into reports of Russian atrocities during the war. Scholz lamented the destruction that the war is causing, and said from Irpin, “It is even worse when you see how terribly senseless the violence is that we are seeing here.”
Russia dismissed their visit as empty symbolism. Dmitri Medvedev, the former Russian president who is vice chairman of President Vladimir Putin’s Security Council, on Thursday disparaged the French, German and Italian leaders as “European connoisseurs of frogs, liverwurst and pasta.”

Ukraine’s desperate struggle to hold on to its territory in the eastern Donbas region reached a critical point on Tuesday. Ukrainian and Russian soldiers clashed in street battles in the city of Sievierodonetsk, and the last bridge linking the city with Ukrainian-controlled territory to the west was destroyed.
After weeks of intense fighting, Russia appeared closer than ever to claiming Sievierodonetsk, potentially handing President Vladimir Putin a substantial victory he can present to the Russian people. It could also help bring him a step closer to taking complete control of the strategically important Donbas region, his primary military goal after his forces failed to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other big cities.
Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, photographers with The New York Times have been documenting the war and following the flow of refugees across Europe. Read the latest updates on the war at the link in our bio.

Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has jolted Taiwan into confronting the prospect of a sudden attack from the island’s own larger and more powerful neighbor: China.
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has long laid claim to self-governed Taiwan — much as President Vladimir Putin of Russia did with Ukraine. Taiwanese Army reservists are training harder than they ever have before, running military drills in their airspace and simulating attacks on buildings.
The war in Ukraine has been a lesson in the tactics and weaponry that could slow a more powerful invading force. A growing number of Taiwanese people have been making their own preparations so they will not be defenseless in the event of war. “Ukraine showed us that you need to first show to others that you have the resolve to defend yourself; only then will others come and help,” said Wu Chiuan-syun, a computer engineer in Taipei.
In May, civilians participated in battle simulations during a combat medic training workshop near Taipei and, in Hsinchu, rescue workers took part in exercises simulating buildings and public transportation being attacked by Chinese missiles.

In a nation at war, and a city aching for some semblance of normalcy, the Odesa Opera reopened on Friday for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion. The performances began with an impassioned rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem. The 1810 theater, protected by piles of sandbags, was about a third full as a result of security restrictions.
“We got permission to perform from the military 10 days ago, and today is pure happiness,” said Viacheslav Chernukho-Volichthe, the opera’s chief conductor. “At the start of the war the explosions and sirens terrified me, as if I had plunged into some unreality, a World War II movie, but humans get used to everything. It is difficult, yet we want to believe in the victory of civilization.”
Odesa has been generally quiet in the past few weeks, but just 70 miles to the east — in the port city of Mykolaiv — Russian shelling continues daily.
Prior to the performances, which included pieces by the Odesa-born composer Kostiantyn Dankevych, there were reminders of the ongoing war. A theater official reminded patrons that if they heard sirens, they should proceed to the shelter within the theater, adding: “You are the soul of this opera house, and we think it’s very important to demonstrate after 115 days of silence that we are able to perform.”
