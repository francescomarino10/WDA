But a poll released on Sunday showed that a majority of women in the U.S. \u2014 67% \u2014 opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, and 52% of Americans said it was a step backward for the nation.\nIn dozens of interviews this week, American women who support abortion rights recalled the moment when they heard that Roe had been overturned. They reflected on how access to legal abortion had quietly undergirded their personal decisions, even if they had never sought one themselves. They worried that the progress many women have made since abortion was legalized \u2014 in education, in the workplace and in the culture \u2014 would be halted.\nAnd they reconsidered their own plans and those of their children in states where abortion has been banned; how they could help other women with unwanted pregnancies; and whether they would ever recover the constitutional right to receive a safe abortion, a guarantee that tens of millions of women have known their entire lives.", "After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

And a new state law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy is set to take effect July 1, although Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in the state have sued to try to block it.\nOn top of those changes, the Supreme Court is poised to issue a ruling that could overturn Roe v.

It is based on data from James Hansen, a retired NASA climate scientist and professor . To create the curves, Hansen and two colleagues compared actual summer temperatures across the world for each decade since the 1980s to a fixed baseline average.\nDuring their base period, 1951 to 1980, about a third of local summer temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere were in a \u201cnear average\u201d or normal range. A third were considered cold, a third were hot, and only a few values could be found at the extremes. Since then, summer temperatures have shifted drastically, the researchers found.

A peaceful resolution to end the war in Ukraine is possible.", "Accidents are common in Ukraine\u2019s aging coal mines. Methane gas, a byproduct of coal mining, is highly explosive. In 2007, a methane blast killed more than 100 miners. Now, Russia\u2019s heavy, indiscriminate bombing has added yet another threat to Ukraine\u2019s coal mines, where personal fears and global anxieties meet.\nUkraine relies on coal for its industrial iron and steel sectors. Coal-fueled thermal power plants generate about one-third of the country\u2019s electricity. For its supply of coal, Ukraine has relied on imports, mostly from Russia, but that supply has been cut by the war, so continuing to mine the domestic supply has become essential for survival.", "Video Shows Missile Striking Ukrainian Mall\nSurveillance footage shared by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine showed the moment a Russian missile struck a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk.  the death toll rose to at least 18 people, with more injured and many unaccounted for.", " energy embargo on Russia \u2014 to end the fighting in Ukraine .\nlike Dominika Lasota and her comrade, Wiktoria Jedroszkowiak, both 20, have emerged as leaders in a dynamic new wing of the antiwar movement. They say the only solution to the war in Ukraine and that until then, more Ukrainians will needlessly die.\nLviv, a city in Ukraine\u2019s relatively safe west, is largely untouched by the war physically, but death reaches here anyway. Residents bury the bodies of soldiers killed fighting in battlefields farther east. Displaced families that fled Russian forces must inter their loved ones here, far from home.\nThe task of interring the dead has fallen to gravediggers, embalmers, funeral directors and coroners. These workers carry deep psychic wounds of war \u2014 and there are few who can relate to them.\n\u201cNowadays, I feel numb,\u201d said Antoniy, a morgue worker in Lviv. \u201cEven when someone is telling me a joke that I know is funny, I can\u2019t laugh. My emotions are too numbed.\u201d\nA senior adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president recently estimated that about 100 to 200 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day, an increase from just a few weeks earlier, when President Volodymyr Zelensky said 60 to 100 were killed daily.\n\u201cWe used to do one or two funerals a month. Now, we\u2019re short-handed,\u201d said Mikhailo, a gravedigger who buries many of the dead that Antoniy prepares for burial. \u201d", "A mass grave on the edge of Lysychansk, in eastern Ukraine, remains uncovered. The dead are civilians who were killed by shelling in recent months in the embattled twin cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk and the nearby town of Rubizhne. \nStanding above the grave, Pvt. Sergiy Veklenko, 41, explained why the bodies were still exposed: \u201cAll of our machinery that we had in the city\u2019s inventory \u2014 excavators and all \u2014 was given to the army for digging trenches.\u201d\nAs the war grinds into its fourth month and Ukrainian and Russian casualties mount well into the thousands of dead, it is clear that the trenches also have become graves for many soldiers.\nPrivate Veklenko, a former police officer who joined the Ukrainian army when the war began, estimates that 300 people are buried in the mass grave. \u201cWe\u2019ve been burying people here who died since April,\u201d he said.\nAs Russia solidifies control in Sievierodonetsk and shifts its focus to neighboring Lysychansk, civilian casualties there are sure to mount, unless Ukrainian forces retreat. Lysychansk, an industrial city with a prewar population of 100,000, is largely cut off from the outside world, with no cellphone service or electricity. Local officials estimate that 40,000 people remain in the city.", "The leaders of France, Germany and Italy met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Thursday in their first such show of support for him since Russia\u2019s invasion began in February. The visit comes as questions mount over European backing for Ukraine and as Zelensky calls for heavier weapons to offset Moscow\u2019s artillery advantage.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy follow a host of European leaders who have traveled overland to the capital, Kyiv, with air travel off limits because of security concerns.\nThe European leaders also traveled to Irpin, a Kyiv suburb where investigators are looking into reports of Russian atrocities during the war. Scholz lamented the destruction that the war is causing, and said from Irpin, \u201cIt is even worse when you see how terribly senseless the violence is that we are seeing here.\u201d\nRussia dismissed their visit as empty symbolism.

Ukrainian and Russian soldiers clashed in street battles in the city of Sievierodonetsk, and the last bridge linking the city with Ukrainian-controlled territory to the west was destroyed.\nAfter weeks of intense fighting, Russia appeared closer than ever to claiming Sievierodonetsk, potentially handing President Vladimir Putin  he can present to the Russian people. It could also help bring him a step closer to taking complete control of the strategically important Donbas region, his primary military goal after his forces failed to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other big cities.\nSince the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have been documenting the war and following the flow of refugees across Europe.

Taiwanese Army reservists are training harder than they ever have before, running military drills in their airspace and simulating attacks on buildings.\nThe war in Ukraine has been a lesson in the tactics and weaponry that could slow a more powerful invading force. A growing number of Taiwanese people have been making their own preparations so they will not be defenseless in the event of war. \u201cUkraine showed us that you need to first show to others that you have the resolve to defend yourself; only then will others come and help,\u201d said Wu Chiuan-syun, a computer engineer in Taipei.\n civilians participated in battle simulations during a combat medic training workshop near Taipei and, in Hsinchu, rescue workers took part in exercises simulating buildings and public transportation being attacked by Chinese missiles.", "In a nation at war, and a city aching for some semblance of normalcy, the Odesa Opera reopened  for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion. The performances began with an impassioned rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem. The 1810 theater, protected by piles of sandbags, was about a third full as a result of security restrictions.\n At the start of the war the explosions and sirens terrified me, as if I had plunged into some unreality, a World War II movie, but humans get used to everything. \nOdesa has been generally quiet in the past few weeks, but just 70 miles to the east \u2014 in the port city of Mykolaiv \u2014 Russian shelling continues daily.\n"]
