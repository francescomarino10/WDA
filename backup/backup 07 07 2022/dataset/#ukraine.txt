Catherine Russell, @atayesheunfpa call for an immediate cessation of all attacks in #Ukraine.
The horrific attacks in 🇺🇦 are killing & causing serious injuries  , destroying  infrastructure .
To attack the most vulnerable is an act of unconscionable cruelty.
Since the start of the war, . In 24 incidents  facilities were damaged or destroyed, while in 5 cases ambulances were damaged or destroyed. These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths & 34 injuries, 
The  system in 🇺🇦 is clearly under significant strain, & its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening.
Humanitarian partners workers must be able to safely maintain & strengthen essential service delivery, incl. 
It is critical that humanitarian actors have safe & unimpeded access to reach ALL civilians in need wherever they may be.
@unicef, @unfpa & WHO are working with partners to scale up life-saving services & support to meet urgent needs.
services should be protected from all acts of violence & obstruction. For the sake of workers, & for all people in Ukraine who need access to the lifesaving services they provide, attacks on all other civilian infrastructure must stop.
Finally, we call for an immediate ceasefire, which includes unhindered access so that people in need can access humanitarian assistance. A peaceful resolution to end the war in Ukraine is possible.

Accidents are common in Ukraine’s aging coal mines. Methane gas, a byproduct of coal mining, is highly explosive. In 2007, a methane blast killed more than 100 miners. Now, Russia’s heavy, indiscriminate bombing has added yet another threat to Ukraine’s coal mines, where personal fears and global anxieties meet.
Ukraine relies on coal for its industrial iron and steel sectors. Coal-fueled thermal power plants generate about one-third of the country’s electricity. For its supply of coal, Ukraine has relied on imports, mostly from Russia, but that supply has been cut by the war, so continuing to mine the domestic supply has become essential for survival.

Video Shows Missile Striking Ukrainian Mall
Surveillance footage shared by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine showed the moment a Russian missile struck a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk.  the death toll rose to at least 18 people, with more injured and many unaccounted for.

 energy embargo on Russia — to end the fighting in Ukraine .
like Dominika Lasota and her comrade, Wiktoria Jedroszkowiak, both 20, have emerged as leaders in a dynamic new wing of the antiwar movement. They say the only solution to the war in Ukraine and that until then, more Ukrainians will needlessly die.
Lviv, a city in Ukraine’s relatively safe west, is largely untouched by the war physically, but death reaches here anyway. Residents bury the bodies of soldiers killed fighting in battlefields farther east. Displaced families that fled Russian forces must inter their loved ones here, far from home.
The task of interring the dead has fallen to gravediggers, embalmers, funeral directors and coroners. These workers carry deep psychic wounds of war — and there are few who can relate to them.
“Nowadays, I feel numb,” said Antoniy, a morgue worker in Lviv. “Even when someone is telling me a joke that I know is funny, I can’t laugh. My emotions are too numbed.”
A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president recently estimated that about 100 to 200 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day, an increase from just a few weeks earlier, when President Volodymyr Zelensky said 60 to 100 were killed daily.
“We used to do one or two funerals a month. Now, we’re short-handed,” said Mikhailo, a gravedigger who buries many of the dead that Antoniy prepares for burial. ”

A mass grave on the edge of Lysychansk, in eastern Ukraine, remains uncovered. The dead are civilians who were killed by shelling in recent months in the embattled twin cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk and the nearby town of Rubizhne. 
Standing above the grave, Pvt. Sergiy Veklenko, 41, explained why the bodies were still exposed: “All of our machinery that we had in the city’s inventory — excavators and all — was given to the army for digging trenches.”
As the war grinds into its fourth month and Ukrainian and Russian casualties mount well into the thousands of dead, it is clear that the trenches also have become graves for many soldiers.
Private Veklenko, a former police officer who joined the Ukrainian army when the war began, estimates that 300 people are buried in the mass grave. “We’ve been burying people here who died since April,” he said.
As Russia solidifies control in Sievierodonetsk and shifts its focus to neighboring Lysychansk, civilian casualties there are sure to mount, unless Ukrainian forces retreat. Lysychansk, an industrial city with a prewar population of 100,000, is largely cut off from the outside world, with no cellphone service or electricity. Local officials estimate that 40,000 people remain in the city.

The leaders of France, Germany and Italy met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Thursday in their first such show of support for him since Russia’s invasion began in February. The visit comes as questions mount over European backing for Ukraine and as Zelensky calls for heavier weapons to offset Moscow’s artillery advantage.
President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy follow a host of European leaders who have traveled overland to the capital, Kyiv, with air travel off limits because of security concerns.
The European leaders also traveled to Irpin, a Kyiv suburb where investigators are looking into reports of Russian atrocities during the war. Scholz lamented the destruction that the war is causing, and said from Irpin, “It is even worse when you see how terribly senseless the violence is that we are seeing here.”
Russia dismissed their visit as empty symbolism. Dmitri Medvedev, the former Russian president who is vice chairman of President Vladimir Putin’s Security Council, on Thursday disparaged the French, German and Italian leaders as “European connoisseurs of frogs, liverwurst and pasta.”

Ukraine’s desperate struggle to hold on to its territory in the eastern Donbas region reached a critical point . Ukrainian and Russian soldiers clashed in street battles in the city of Sievierodonetsk, and the last bridge linking the city with Ukrainian-controlled territory to the west was destroyed.
After weeks of intense fighting, Russia appeared closer than ever to claiming Sievierodonetsk, potentially handing President Vladimir Putin  he can present to the Russian people. It could also help bring him a step closer to taking complete control of the strategically important Donbas region, his primary military goal after his forces failed to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other big cities.
Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have been documenting the war and following the flow of refugees across Europe. 

Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has jolted Taiwan into confronting the prospect of a sudden attack from the island’s own larger and more powerful neighbor: China.
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has long laid claim to self-governed Taiwan — much as President Vladimir Putin of Russia did with Ukraine. Taiwanese Army reservists are training harder than they ever have before, running military drills in their airspace and simulating attacks on buildings.
The war in Ukraine has been a lesson in the tactics and weaponry that could slow a more powerful invading force. A growing number of Taiwanese people have been making their own preparations so they will not be defenseless in the event of war. “Ukraine showed us that you need to first show to others that you have the resolve to defend yourself; only then will others come and help,” said Wu Chiuan-syun, a computer engineer in Taipei.
 civilians participated in battle simulations during a combat medic training workshop near Taipei and, in Hsinchu, rescue workers took part in exercises simulating buildings and public transportation being attacked by Chinese missiles.

In a nation at war, and a city aching for some semblance of normalcy, the Odesa Opera reopened  for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion. The performances began with an impassioned rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem. The 1810 theater, protected by piles of sandbags, was about a third full as a result of security restrictions.
 At the start of the war the explosions and sirens terrified me, as if I had plunged into some unreality, a World War II movie, but humans get used to everything. 
Odesa has been generally quiet in the past few weeks, but just 70 miles to the east — in the port city of Mykolaiv — Russian shelling continues daily.
