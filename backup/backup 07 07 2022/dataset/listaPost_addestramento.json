Her son is among the first of many babies expected in a post-Roe Texas. \n\nOne in 10 people of reproductive age in America live in Texas, which will soon outlaw almost all abortions.

I protect my kids. Only a mom can know what is best for herself and her family.

Ron DeSantis in April, will not be enforced for now. Florida currently allows abortions until 24 weeks, making the state a refuge for women seeking the procedure from across Southeastern states with tighter restrictions.\n\nJudge Cooper said he would issue a temporary statewide injunction. It will not be binding until he signs a written order, something the judge said would not happen on Thursday.

The issue will most likely end up before the Florida Supreme Court, which in the past has cited a privacy amendment that voters wrote into the State Constitution in 1980 to block other abortion restrictions from taking effect.

The people familiar with the case anticipate an outcome the week of July 4, although there remains a chance of it coming sooner. His arbitration hearing is scheduled to begin this upcoming week. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe NFL Players Association and Watson\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, are preparing to vigorously fight such a tough ban of the embattled Cleveland Browns quarterback. Watson has been accused by dozens of women of sexual assault or other forms of misconduct during massage therapy sessions. Watson, who has denied any wrongdoing, settled 20 of the 24 civil suits against him in the last week. \u2060\n\u2060\nWatson\u2019s is the first case under the NFL\u2019s new collectively bargained personal conduct policy, which places the initial ruling in the hands of a neutral arbitrator. In this case, that is former U.S. District Court judge Sue Robinson, who was picked mutually by the league and the players\u2019 union. If she determines Watson violated the league\u2019s personal conduct policy and suspends him, either side can appeal the length of that suspension to commissioner Roger Goodell or someone he designates. \u2060\n\u2060\nRead more at the link in our bio.\u2060\n\u2060\nPhoto: Nick Cammett/Getty Images", "Follow @latimes_sports for the latest updates on Britney Griner\u2019s trial, as we will be sure to follow up with more reels for every major development in this case. \n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @mediajonny & @cgpriceisright \n\n#britneygriner #britneygrinerrussianjail", "California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed a controversial bill to repeal a provision of state law that bans loitering for the intent to sell sex \u2014 a proposal that deeply divided Democrats in the Legislature and pitted transgender rights activists against advocates to stop human trafficking.\n\nAnti-loitering laws have been contentious nationwide, in part because they are often vague in their definition of what constitutes as loitering, which gives police wide latitude to arrest or disperse individuals. While New York state and cities such as Seattle have repealed anti-loitering laws, California now becomes the largest state to do so.\n\nIn his signing statement released on Friday, Newsom alluded to the difficult political debate around the bill, but noted that it \u201cdoes not legalize prostitution.\u201d\n\nLink in bio for more. \ud83d\udcf8 Paul Kuroda/For The Times", "\u201cIn these grim post-Roe days, more than half the states in the country are in the process of banning or severely curtailing access to abortion. In every state that outright bans abortion, that prohibition extends to medication abortion \u2014 a simple and safe two-pill regimen that has been available for more than two decades.\n\nBut it is not clear that bans on medication abortion are legal. Taking abortion pills is not the same as having a procedure in a clinic, and regulating drugs is not the same as regulating medical procedures. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has long had the authority to decide what drugs are safe and efficacious and should be on the market. States regulate medical practice within their borders but generally do not have the right to override FDA decisions on drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the federal government to go to court and argue that every state banning medication abortion has overstepped its authority and is thwarting access to an FDA-approved drug,\u201d writes the Times Editorial Board.\n\nLink in bio for more. \ud83d\udcf8 Associated Press", "The groundwork that would ultimately lead to the #RoevsWade ruling began in #California.

Her doctor was arrested shortly after performing it.
