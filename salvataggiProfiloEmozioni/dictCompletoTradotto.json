{"Cc0kniOssYS": "@ryerson_u president Mohamed Lachemi recommended the Toronto Metropolitan name from a shortlist developed by a committee of professors, administrators, students and alumni. The decision was voted on at a board meeting Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe renaming process began last year in response to a task force that examined the legacy of the university\u2019s namesake, 19th century educational reformer Egerton Ryerson and his connection to the design of the residential schools system.\n\nProtests over the use of the Ryerson name date back more than a decade. The task force decided that his name had become linked for many people with a system that that has been called an act of cultural genocide, because it forcibly separated Indigenous children from their families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name that fits us perfectly,\u201d said Dr. Lachemi. \u201cWe\u2019re located in the heart of our country\u2019s biggest and most diverse city, so the university represents all that it means to be metropolitan.\"\n\nAlthough the new name bears some similarity to that of its neighbour the University of Toronto, Dr. Lachemi said he thinks there\u2019s a distinctive niche for the Toronto Metropolitan University. He pointed out that London Metropolitan University exists alongside the University of London, and Tokyo Metropolitan University exists alongside the University of Tokyo.\n\nFollow the link in our bio for the full story by Joe Friesen.\n.\n.\n#Ryerson #TorontoMetropolitanUniversity", "CcyBkF7sdes": "The assertion by some that vaccine choice is best left to individuals is being undermined by a new Canadian study.\n\nWhile most governments have scaled back on COVID-19 data collection and reporting, indicators including wastewater surveillance show high levels of transmission across the country.

They stranded several times in nowhere.\n\nElon himself, born in Pretoria in 1970, hardly got to know the grandfather, because a few years later he broke the neck in an aircraft accident. But the stories of the grandfather's thirst for adventure shaped the childhood of the young nut. Pioneering spirit was considered a high virtue in the family.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Pictures: Patrick Pleul / Reuters, Paul Harris / Getty, Yichuan Cao / Nurphoto / Getty, Will Heath / NBC / Getty, SpaceX / Imago, Hannibal Hanschke / EPA, Joanne Ho-Young Lee / Imago, Kate Allen / Toronto Star / Getty.\n\n#elonmusk #elonmusknews #elonmusktwitter #tesla #spaceX #nzz ", "Ccc_4uEIuUF": "220 years ago, Zurich was a town with around 10,000 inhabitants, which wasolated with two fortifications against outside. Now you can explore the alleys and houses from back then.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Digital city models in 3-D are already available; But now the fourth dimension is added. The city of Zurich has been offering digital city models at two historical times since the beginning of March: one shows the area at the pile dye period (around 3000 BC), the other the town around 1800.\n\nIt takes a little for the data to be loaded. But then you can really immerse yourself in the city around 1800. You can see the two bridges from back then, the wide vegetable bridge next to the town hall and the wooden jetty, which is only to become the M\u00fcnster Bridge almost forty years later.\n\nThe vegetable bridge was the only passable transition via the Limmat. The crowd, especially at market times, was huge. That is why the subsequent Marktgasse was also called Fluchgasse. There were already traffic problems at that time. Anyone who wanted to drive through the city with a stagecoach needed patience.\n\nIn large parts, the Zurich looks very different from that time than today. The old monasteries are still standing, such as the Fraum\u00fcnster Abbey. The scratch quarters with the former town house is located against the lake, in which Limmat is the Wellenberg prison tower.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you want to compare with today, you can show the views of 1800 and today on the screen - which enables very exciting comparison.\n\nThe digital models are impressive, but why did you have such an effort for something that seems more like a gimmick at first?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 For Stephan Wyss, the head of Zurich city archeology, the question does not arise. As he emphasizes, the 3-D models are important part of archaeological and scientific work. One also wants to pass on the knowledge to the population and thus encourage the cultural history to deal.\n\nTo the whole article \u27a1 nzz.ch/instagram\n\n#zurich #ig_zurich #3d #archeology #nzz ", "CcINDQhN1fm": "What has been asks about Ukraine since the war of aggression, Mikhail Chodorkowski has been working for 20 years: how far will Putin go?\n\nIn London, the former oil magnate talked about Russia and the man he calls his enemy today.

They used the paths that are spurred by the system. But then the colossus collapsed, and the foundation became Treisand.\n\nAnd again both talent and speed proved to not only survive in it, but to build on it. - By the way, they have one thing in common: the way of speaking quietly, almost hesitantly. And in both vocabulary, \"betrayal\" plays a major role.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 According to the fall of the Iron Curtain, Putin rose from the consultant of his former professor at the University of Saint Petersburg to President Russia within ten years.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 And the other? Chodorkowski was only in the early twenties and almost burst before zest for action and self -confidence when all of Russia suddenly turned into a startup. It was as if, like thousands others, they had left him off their leash. Monopoly in the Wild East.\n\nChodorkowski imported computers, jeans, brandy, exported matroschkas, everything on a large scale, he founded one of the first private banks in Russia and thus pulled the joker, who was supposed to enable him soon to acquire one of the country's big oil companies: Yukos.\n\n#michailchodorkowski #chodorkowski #Putin #Russland #nzz ", "Cc7UTEFtTdB": "A little appreciation to a beautiful picture and the people who put their lives in the service of the general public.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 In 1961, when @ignaziocassis was born, Queen Elisabeth II was on a journey through India: no longer as an empress of the country that has been independent for 13 years, but as head of the Commonwealth. Already at the airport, where President Prasad was picked up with the State Mercedes, they were waiting for crowds. The jubilation that hit her and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, was huge.\n\nIn the 61 years that have passed since then, the English queen worked through, and Ignazio Cassis lived a whole life: childhood in Sessa, altar boy in the church and trumpeter in village music. High school in Lugano. Studies. Work as a doctor. Political career. Group leader of the FDP. Federal Council. Federal President.\n\nThe workload of work that the Queen has done in their 70 years as a regent of Great Britain is inconceivable. Since the death of her husband and since her corona disease, she has withdrawn to Windsor. But for Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola, she took the time.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \u00abThis Afternoon the Queen Received the Presited of Switzerland, MR Ignazio Cassis, for an audience at Windsor Castle,\u00bb said the Royal Family.

But it deserves a little appreciation. The Queen has been in service for 70 years, Ignazio Cassis has been politically involved for 20 years. The two lives can hardly be compared.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 But they have something in common: the service to the general public. Grateful moments are rare.

The man, who was wearing a construction vest, put on a gas mask before firing shots that hit people on the train and the nearby platform at the 36th Street Station in the Sunset Park neighborhood, Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. As of Tuesday afternoon, the gunman had not yet been publicly identified and remained at large. \n\nThe Fire Department said that five people were in critical condition, but none of them had suffered life-threatening injuries. The shooting set off panic and chaos as riders fled from the train and the station through billowing smoke. The violent episode came amid a heightened fear of crime as New York City struggles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJohn Butsikares, 15, a freshman at Brooklyn Technical High School, said his ride on a northbound R train from Bay Ridge had been calm \u2014 until the train approached the 36th Street station.

Capturing it requires technical skill and a bit of luck.\n\nBioluminescent organisms \u2014 like fireflies and anglerfish \u2014 create light from energy released by chemical reactions inside their bodies. Bioluminescence is most common in the ocean, and it usually appears as blue-green because that is what cuts through seawater the best. The specific flashes of blue-green light come in response to pressure changes that waves create as they crash.\n\nPhotographers who hunt bioluminescence in New Zealand say that summer is generally the best time to spot it, especially on nights after rainstorms. \u201cWhen you find it, when you strike blue gold, it is just such a good feeling,\u201d said Matthew Davison, who lives in Auckland and sometimes stays out until sunrise shooting bioluminescence.\n\nTap the link in our bio to read more about the photographers who chase bioluminescence.
